use f in end of literals because
point literals like 2.34 5.56 etc are 
by default double but if we want them to be float put the like
2.34f, 5.56f.

Special case
float f = 2.34;
in above case 2.34 is automatically convereted to float by compiler (called implicit conversion)
but for a very small bit speed benefit you can use as
float f = 2.34f;
