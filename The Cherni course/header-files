Header file is a file in c++ is to generally declare the functions variables and all other constructs
so that we do not have to define bby ourseleves in everyfile where we use that funcction.

so header file contains declarations

extension .h

#pragma once

start with # --> preprocessor directive or preprocessr command

#pragma once is used as header guard
means it prevents us from including the a header file for more than once in a single translational unit.
(think of chain of include to it be happen)

#pragma once --> is new thing earliier to it we use the following to prevent duplicat errors

#ifndef \_LOG_H
#define \_LOG_H
void log(const char\* message)
#endif

# Difference between quotes and angular brackets

quotes --> to include any file
angular brackets --> to include files which are in include path
we are learning about include path later

# iostream has no extension why

iostream is a header file from c++ standard library
to distinguish c++ library files from c library files
c++ library developers make them wiithout extension so one cann easilt determine

#include<iostream> --> c++
#include<stdlib.h> --> c
