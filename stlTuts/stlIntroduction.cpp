STL standard template library

Why It is , This library contating various utilities , generic classes and generic functions
and datastructures and constructs that allow us to write our program quicklt and efficiently.

Components of STL

1. Container  containers are data structures that allows storage collection of objects 
2. Iterator   this are pointer like objects help in traversal of containers
3. Algorithms  this are set of functions that are implemented in efficient manner example search sort modify count reverse etc. generally declared in <algorithm.h>
4. Functors ( function objects)   this are the classes that overload the () operator for taking arguments and calls the necessary functions automatically generally declared in <functional.h>
