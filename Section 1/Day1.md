Object Oriented programming

Some problems are faced by developers by seeing large programs and their mainatainablity
then a large group academics innovate a guideline for better understanable , thinkable

that guidelines are based on concept of objects and thats why known as object oriented programming

so

"OOP is a programming paradigm which revolve around the concept of object"
